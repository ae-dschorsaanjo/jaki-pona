# jaki pona

jaki pona (the "good sh\*t") is a toki pona grammar booklet and dictionary, in two languages (English and Hungarian) in the future: Hungarian translation has not been started yet.

You can read it on [github pages](https://ae-dschorsaanjo.github.io/jaki-pona/), or read the [English version](./jaki_pona-en.md) and the future [Hungarian version](./jaki_pona-hu.md) directly; the latter options are not recommended since the web version is created using a [Python script](./render.py), and the markdown files are using extended markdown syntax which is not fully compatible with [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## sitelen pona leko

It is a pixel variant of sitelen pona that's been drawn specifically for this project. However, it can also be used by itself.
The following variants are available (these can also be found in the [docs/pics/sitelen_pona_leko/](docs/pics/sitelen_pona_leko/) folder):
- [main (black and white)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ae-dschorsaanjo/jaki-pona/refs/heads/main/docs/pics/sitelen_pona_leko/sitelen-pona-leko.png)
- [standalone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ae-dschorsaanjo/jaki-pona/refs/heads/main/docs/pics/sitelen_pona_leko/sitelen-pona-leko-standalone.png)

- [practice sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ae-dschorsaanjo/jaki-pona/refs/heads/main/docs/pics/sitelen_pona_leko/sitelen-pona-leko-practice-sheet.png)

The font used on these is [Zont 4x5](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2419509/zont-4x5), also under CC0.

## Requirements

Python3 to render the output from the raw files.

The main output is in the [docs/](./docs/) folder that can be printed into an "abridged" version. (which is the same as the web version, only with the examples and a few inessential paragraphs removed).
