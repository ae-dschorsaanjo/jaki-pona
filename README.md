# jaki pona

jaki pona (the "good sh\*t") is a toki pona grammar booklet and dictionary, in two languages (English and Hungarian) in the future: Hungarian translation has not been started yet.

You can read it on [github pages](.), or read the [English version](./jaki_pona-en.md) and the future [Hungarian version](./jaki_pona-hu.md) directly; the latter options are not recommended since the web version is created using a [Python script](./render.py), and the markdown files are using extended markdown syntax which is not fully compatible with [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## Requirements

Python3 to render the output from the raw files.

The main output is in the [docs/](./docs/) folder that can be printed into an "abridged" version. (which is the same as the web version, only with the examples and a few inessential paragraphs removed).
