*toki pona* ("the language of good", "good language") is a minimalist constructed language created by Sonja Lang that was first published in 2001.  

*jaki pona* ("the good sh&ast;t") is a short summary&nbsp;of the language that comes bundled&nbsp;with a dictionary (that is derived from&nbsp;*lipu&nbsp;lili&nbsp;pi&nbsp;toki&nbsp;pona*).

## Basic Structure

toki pona has a 13 letter alphabet (`a`, `e`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `s`, `t`, `u`, `w`). Only proper names are capitalized, everything else is written in lower case. Syllables have a CVn structure (consonant, vovel, optional *'n'*). However, there are four *forbidden pairings* (`ji`, `wo`, `wu` and `ti` -- the latter becomes `si` instead), and word-initial consonant may be absent.  
Letters correspond to the sounds they mark in [IPA](https://www.ipachart.com/), though additional voicing and some variations are allowed.

There are only three pronouns, `mi` (I/we), `sina` (you) and `ona` (he/she/it/they).  

Sentences have a simple subject-verb-object word order. Subjects and the predicate (often a verb; toki pona does not have a word for "to be", hence we will use the more generic term "predicate") are separated by the word `li`, unless the subject is only *"mi"* or *"sina"*. Predicates and objects are separated by `e` and does not by themselves have a tense. Adjectives and adverbs, collectively called *modifiers*, go after the noun, (as opposed to English).  
Similar to preposition, there are *auxiliary-* or *pre-verbs* that can precede the verb or predicate. Usual examples are `kama` (will) or `wile` (need, must).

> mi moku e pan. | I eat bread.
> mi mute li lukin e tomo. | We are watching the house.
> ona li tawa tomo. | She is going home.
> ona li wile tawa tomo. | It wants to go home.
> ona li tomo tawa. | He is a car.
> ona li tawa tomo tawa. | They are going to \[their] car.
> tomo tawa li tawa tomo. | The car is going home.
> mi tomo tawa wile li wile tawa tomo mi. | I am a wannabe car and \[I] want to go to my apartment.

## Transliterating Names

Proper names should be transliterated to toki pona, following standard toki pona grammar. Proper names are treated as *modifiers*. The following conventions are usually used, although they are not hard rules:

1. Number of syllables should remain the same.
2. The letter *'r'* should become *'l'*, *'w'* or *'k'* (depending on pronunciation).
3. Dental fricatives (*'th'*) becomes either `s` (when voiceless) or `t` (when voiced).
4. Consonant clusted should either be split or reduced to a single consonant.
5. Vowel clusters should become split into multiple syllables with added consonants.
6. Transliterated names should not be the same as existing toki pona words or, in other words: toki pona words should not be used as names.

## Sentence Types and Punctuation

Declarative sentences should not need further explanation for now.  
Question end with a question mark, and can be formed in *three ways:*
1. Repeating the pre-verb or predicate and putting an *"ala"* between them.
2. Putting *"anu seme?"* at the end of the sentence.
3. Putting *"seme"* in place of the thing you want to question.

The exclamation point is used for *three different ways:*
1. To form imperative (command) sentences, in which case, `o` is used in front of the verb and the subject may be ommitted; if it is not, then `o` may *replace* `li`.
2. To form interjections, like *"moku pona!"* (good appetite!).
3. To emphasize a declarative sentence; this way it visually shows verbal emphasis.

> sina lukin e ona. | You look at him.
> sina lukin ala lukin e ona? | Are you looking at him?
> sina lukin e ona anu seme? | You are looking at him or what?
> sina lukin e seme? | What are you looking at?
> seme li lukin e sina? | What is looking at you?
> sina seme e ona? | What are you doing to him?
> o lukin e ona! | Look at him!
> sina o lukin e ona! | You, look at him!

Colons are used after `e` or a preposition is followed by `ni`. These are used when the *object* is another sentence (in case of `e`), or in certain situations to form compound sentences. The preposition used are most often *"tan"* ("because") and *"sama"* ("like, similar"). The latter is rather rare and often does not translate directly.

> mi pilin pona tan ni: soweli suwi mi li mu. | I feel good, because my cat is purring.
> ona li sona e tenpo sama ni: jan ale li tawa kon. | She knows a time when everyone is flying.
> sina tawa sama ni: jan li wile pakala e sina. | You are running as if people would want to hurt you.

Commas can be used freely to visually separate parts of a sentence, although customarily they are only put before *prepositions*, and either before or after `la`.

## Prepositions and Conjunctions

Prepositions are followed by noun phrases (nouns and modifiers; along with the prepositions, they are called *prepositional phrases*) and they can be put after virtually any noun phrase (such as the subject or object) to modify or specify their meanings. There are 5 prepositions in toki pona, `kepeken` (with), `lon` (at), `sama` (like), `tan` (from, because) and `tawa` (to, for). When these are used at the end of sentences, then their meaning may apply to the whole sentence as opposed to the (last) object; most often this is a *'lon'* structure indicating physical locations or time.

Conjunctions, with the exception of `taso`, must be used along with `la` (see under *Advanced Grammar*), or they have special sentence structures. The following ones are available:

1. And
    - Between subjects, use `en`.
    - Between verbs, use `li`
    - Betwen object, use `e`.
    - To apply to the whole sentence (linking it to the previous one), begin the sentence with `kin la` (alternatively `en la`).
    - Between modifiers, use `pi M1 en M2` (where *M1* and *M2* are modifiers).
2. Or
    - Same as "and", but always use `anu`.
    - Although `ante la` is used more often than `anu la`.
3. But
    - `taso` is used at the beginning of sentences and nowhere else.
    - To express things like "anything but..." and "except", structures like *'ale en ona ala'* (everything and not it) could be used.

> mi en sina li tawa. | You and I are walking.
> soweli suwi pi suli en laso li musi. | The large and the blue cats are playing.
> jan Sotan li pali li wile moku. | Zotn is working and \[is] hungry.
> ona li moku e pan e telo walo kiwen. | He is eating bread and cheese.
> mi wile e musi anu lape. | I want to enjoy life or sleep.
> ona li wile pali. ante la ona li kama nasa. | She must work, otherwise she'd become crazy.
> mi wile pali e musi. taso mi jo e wawa ala. | I want to make music, but I am exhausted.

## Time and Space

Expressing time and location are very similar: they both use `lon` and they both can be used as the *context* in `la` phrases (see Advanced Grammar).

*Time* is expressed as a noun phrase using `tenpo` and modifiers. The most common ones are `kama` (for future), `pini` (for past), `ni` (for present), `suno` (for day/daytime), `pimeja` (for night); *"kama"*, *"pini"* and *"ni"* are often used in conjunction with the latter two.

> ona li lape lon tenpo pimeja. | She sleeps at night.
> ona li kama apeja lon tenpo suno ni. | Today she'll be miserable.
> tenpo kama la ona li tawa tomo pali. | She will go to work.
> tenpo pini la ona li pali ala. | She didn't work before.
> tenpo ni la ona li moku. | She is eating now.

*Space* works similar to time, but with more variance: instead of having a single noun, we can use `ma` (for place in general; also "outside"), `tomo` (for house/building) and `ma tomo` (for city/settlement). Spatial nouns after `lon` mean current location, while if they are preceded by `tawa`, they specify directions:

insa
: inside, within, among

poka
: on the side, next to, besides

sewi
: above

anpa
: below, under

sinpin
: in front, before

monsi
: behind, at the back, after

> soweli li lon insa tomo. | The cat is in the house.
> soweli li lon poka pi jan lawa ona. | The dog is next to its owner.
> soweli li lape lon soweli ante. | The cat is sleeping on the dog.
> musi kiwen li lon supa lon sewi pi ilo pi sitelen tawa. | The \[cat] statue is on a shelf above the telly.
> soweli li lape lon anpa supa. | The cat is sleeping under the bed.
> soweli li tawa monsi tomo. | The cat goes behind the house \[presumably to sleep].

## Numbers

Numbers are relatively rare as neither pronouns nor nouns are inherently *singular* or *plural*. There are 2 major systems of using numbers, that we will refer to as "short range" and "extended range", as well as a "mid range" which is commonly used (though mostly unrecognized):

Number  | Short range | Mid range | Extended range | Note
------- | ----------- | --------- | -------------- | ----
ala     | 0,&nbsp;none| 0,&nbsp;none   | 0         | 
wan     | 1           | 1         | 1              | 
tu      | 2           | 2         | 2              | 
tuli    |             |           | 3              | Archaic, it was removed from the dictionary early on.
po      |             |           | 4              | Archaic, it was removed from the dictionary early on.
luka    |             | 5         | 5              | 
mute    | 3+          | 11+       | 20             | 
ale/ali | all         | all       | 100,&nbsp;all  | Used for "all", "every" and "countless".

Numbers are used as *modifiers*. They always go *after the last modifier,* but *before the first "pi"* (see Advanced Grammar). Numbers without specific words for them are formed by adding them up, starting with the largest -- does not apply to short range. For example, *"luka tu wan"* is 8 (5&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1), while *"tu tu"* is 4 (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2).  
Ordinal numbers are expressed using `nanpa` followed by the number and work the same as regular numbers.

> soweli suwi tu wan | Three cats
> soweli suwi tuli | Three cats
> soweli suwi nanpa tu wan | The third cat

## Advanced Grammar

`pi` is used to group modifiers. For example, *"jan pona suli mute"* would mean "big friends", but *"jan pona pi suli mute"* would mean "\[a] very big friend".  
When spatial nouns are used in *prepositional phrases* (either after *"lon"* or *"tawa"*), *"pi"* can be put after the spatial noun if they are followed by more than one word.  
*Possessors* are modifiers as well and they go *after all the other modifiers*. If the possessor is more than one word or could be mistaken for a regular modifier, then put a *"pi"* before them.

> soweli suwi mi | my cat
> soweli suwi tu mi | my two cats
> soweli suwi mute pi jan Kalen | Karen's cats
> soweli suwi tomo | indoor cat OR the house's cat
> soweli suwi pi tomo | the house's cat

The word `la` is used to separate *context* (or *condition*) and *main sentence*. The latter is a normal sentence, but the context can be virtually any phrase or a full sentence; most often it is a full sentence or a phrase denoting the time.  
Prepositional phrases may be places in front of *'la'* to indicate that its meaning applies to the whole sentence, although the preposition itself may be dropped.

> mi la pilin uta ona li pona. | I like its taste.
> tenpo kama la mi pali mute. | In the future, I shall work more.
> sina lon tomo la suno sewi li ken ala lukin e sina. | When you are at home, the the Sun&nbsp;god is unable to see you.
> lon ma tomo Uso la jan moli li tawa sin. | In Uso, dead people are walking again.
