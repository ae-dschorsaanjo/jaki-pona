*toki pona* ("the language of good", "good language") is a minimalist constructed language created by Sonja Lang that was first published in 2001.  

*jaki pona* ("the good sh&ast;t") is a short overview&nbsp;of the language that comes with a dictionary (which is derived from&nbsp;*lipu&nbsp;lili&nbsp;pi&nbsp;toki&nbsp;pona*).

## Basic Structure

toki pona has a 14 letter alphabet (`a`, `e`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `s`, `t`, `u`, `w`) which is used to create words by forming CVn (consonant, vovel, optional `n`) syllables. However, there are four *forbidden pairings* (`ji`, `wo`, `wu` and `ti` -- the latter becomes `si` instead), and the word-initial consonant may be absent. Only proper names are capitalized, everything else is written in lower case.  
Letters correspond to the sounds they mark in [IPA](https://www.ipachart.com/), though additional voicing and some variations are allowed.

Sentences have a simple subject-verb-object word order. Subjects and the predicate (usually a verb; toki pona does not have a word for "to be", so the more generic term "predicate" will be  used) are separated by the word `li`, unless the subject is only *"mi"* or *"sina"*. Predicates and objects are separated by `e`. Predicates do not have a tense. Adjectives and adverbs, collectively called *modifiers*, go after the noun (as opposed to English).  
Similar to prepositions, there are *auxiliary-* or *pre-verbs* that precede the verb or predicate. Usual examples are `kama` (will) or `wile` (need, must). There are no definite and indefinite articles.

> mi loje. | I am red.  
> ona li loje. | It is red.  
> mi moku e pan. | I eat bread.  
> mi mute li lukin e tomo. | We are watching the house.  
> ona li tawa tomo. | She is going home.  
> ona li wile tawa tomo. | It wants to go home.  
> ona li wile e tomo tawa. | She wants a car.  
> ona li tomo tawa. | He is a car.  
> ona li tawa tomo tawa. | They are going to \[their] car.  
> ona li tawa e tomo tawa. | He moves the car.  
> tomo tawa li tawa tomo. | The car is going home.  
> mi tomo tawa wile li wile tawa tomo mi. | I am a wannabe car and \[I] want to go to my apartment.  

## Transliterating Names

Proper names should be transliterated to toki pona, following standard toki pona grammar. Proper names are treated as *modifiers*, hence the use of a noun in front if them is generally required. The following conventions are customary, although they are not hard rules:

1. Number of syllables should remain the same.
2. The letter *'r'* should become `l`, `w` or `k` (depending on pronunciation).
3. Dental fricatives (*'th'*) becomes either `s` (when voiceless) or `t` (when voiced).
4. Consonant clusters should either be split or reduced to a single consonant.
5. Vowel clusters should become split into multiple syllables with added consonants.
6. toki pona words should not be used as names (unless it is based on real name).

Although there are no explicit rules against the *'nn'* and *'nm'* clusters (when the first syllable ends with an optional `n` and the next one begins with another nasal, e.g. *jan Anna*), it is generally avoided.

## Sentence Types and Punctuation

Technically all punctuation marks are optional variants of the *full stop* (`.`) with the exception of the *colon* (`:`) and the *comma* (`,`). Using [sitelen pona](pics/sitelen_pona_leko/sitelen-pona-leko.png), no punctuation is used and each sentence is written on its own line. This is also done in chats and other informal settings, although *colons* are still used.

Declarative sentences are the default and should not need further explanation.  

Question end with a question mark (`?`), and can be formed in *three ways:*

1. Repeating the pre-verb or predicate, and putting an `ala` between them (yes-no question).
2. Using `seme` in place of the thing you want to question (open ended question).
3. Adding `anu seme?` at the end of the sentence (open ended or closed question), or having `X anu Y` in somewhere in the sentence (closed question).

To answer yes-no question, either the *predicate* (with or without subject) is repeated or `ala` is used; in case of closed questions, the correct option is repeated back. Open ended questions work similar to English.
  
> sina lukin ala lukin e ona? | Are you looking at him?  
> \[mi] lukin. | Yes.  
> mi lukin e ona. | Yes in a longer way.  
> sina lukin e ona anu seme? | You are looking at him \[or what]?  
> \[mi lukin e] ona. | Yes.  
> \[mi lukin e ona] ala. | No.  
> sina lukin e ijo laso anu jelo? | Are you look at the blue thing or the yellow thing?  
> \[mi lukin e ijo] jelo. | The yellow \[one].  
> sina lukin e seme? | What are you looking at?  
> mi lukin e oko sina. | I am looking at your eyes.  
> seme li lukin e sina? | Who is looking at you?  
> jan Anon \[li lukin \[e sina]]. | Anon \[is looking \[at me]].  
> sina seme e ona? | What are you doing to him?  
> \[mi] sitelen \[e ona] | \[I am] drawing \[him].  

The exclamation mark (`!`) is used in *three different ways:*

1. To form imperative ("command") sentences, in which case, `o` is used in front of the verb and the subject may be ommitted; if it is not, then `o` *replaces* `li`.
2. To form interjections, like *"moku pona!"* (good appetite!).
3. To emphasize a declarative sentence; this way it visually shows verbal emphasis.

> o lukin e ona! | Look at him!  
> sina o lukin e ona! | You, look at him!  
> toki! | Hi!  
> tawa pona! | Bye! \[said by the one who stays]  
> mi tawa! | Bye! \[said by the one who leaves]  
> awen pona! | Bye! \[said by the one who leaves]  
> lape pona! | Good sleeping!  
> moku pona! | Good appetite!  

Colons (`:`) are used when a preposition or `e` is followed by `ni`. These are used when the *object* is another sentence (in case of `e`), or in certain situations to form compound sentences. The most often used preposition in this case are `tan` ("because") and `sama` ("like, similar").

> mi pilin pona tan ni: soweli suwi mi li mu. | I feel good, because my cat is purring.  
> jan Sotan li wile e ni: musi ona li pona tawa jan. | Zotn wants people to like his music.  
> ona li sona e tenpo sama ni: jan ale li tawa kon. | She knows a time when everyone is flying.  
> sina tawa sama ni: jan li wile pakala e sina. | You are running as if people would want to hurt you.  

Commas (`,`) can be used freely to visually separate parts of a sentence, although customarily they are only put before *prepositions*, and either before or after `la`.

## Negation and Order of Modifiers

Negation is almost exclusively expressed by using the word `ala` which is a *modifier* in this use.

Modifiers usually do not have a fixed order as it is context dependent, but generally `ala` would be the *last modifier* in a *noun phrase* or a *modifier group* (see *[Advanced Grammar](#advanced-grammar)*), only followed by the possessor (theoreticaly; this is rather rare). However, its placement *may vary* depending on what and how we want to emphasize or connote.

> mi loje ala. | I am not red.  
> mi ala li loje. | Not-I is red.  
> ona ala li loje ala. | Not-it is not-red.  
> mi moku e pan ala. | I am not eating bread.  
> jan ala pi sona mute | No one of knowledge  
> jan pi sona mute ala | Human of no great knowledge  
> jan pi sona ala mute | Man of great lack-of-knowledge  
> ona li tawa tomo ala. | She is going not-home.  
> ona li tawa ala tomo. | She is not going home.  
> ona li wile ala tawa tomo. | It does not want want to go home.  
> ona li wile e tomo tawa ala. | She does not want a car.  
> ni li kili laso ala. | This is not a blue fruit.  
> ni li kili ala laso. | This is a blue thing \[that is not a fruit].  
> mi lon ala ma Amelica. | I am not in the Americas.  
> mi lon ma Mewika ala. | I am in not in the USA. \[but somewhere else].  

## Prepositions and Conjunctions

Prepositions are followed by noun phrases (nouns and modifiers; along with the prepositions, they are called *prepositional phrases*) and they can be put after virtually any noun phrase (such as the subject or object) to modify or specify their meanings. There are 5 prepositions in toki pona, `kepeken` (with), `lon` (at), `sama` (like), `tan` (from, because) and `tawa` (to, for, going to). When these are used at the end of sentences, then their meaning may apply to the whole sentence as opposed to the (last) object; most often this is a *'lon'* structure indicating physical locations or time.

Conjunctions, with the exception of `taso`, must be used along with `la` (see under *[Advanced Grammar](#advanced-grammar)*), or they have special sentence structures. The following ones are available:

- And
    - Between subjects, use `en`.
    - Between verbs, use `li`.
    - Betwen object, use `e`.
    - To apply it to the whole sentence (linking it to the previous one), begin the sentence with `kin la` (alternatively `en la`).
    - Between modifiers, use `pi M1 en M2` (where *M1* and *M2* are the modifiers); this cannot be combined with multiple subjects!
- Or
    - Same as "and", but always use `anu`.
    - Although `ante la` is used more often than `anu la`.
- But
    - `taso` (as a conjunction) is used at the beginning of sentences and nowhere else.
    - To express things like "anything but..." and "except", structures like *"ale en ona ala"* (everything and not it) could be used.

> mi en sina li tawa. | You and I are walking.  
> soweli suwi pi suli en laso li musi. | The large and blue cats are playing.  
> jan Sotan li pali li wile moku. | Zotn is working and \[is] hungry.  
> ona li moku e pan e telo walo kiwen. | He is eating bread and cheese.  
> mi wile e musi anu lape. | I want to enjoy life or sleep.  
> ona li wile pali. ante la ona li kama nasa. | She must work, otherwise she'd become crazy.  
> mi wile pali e musi. taso mi jo e wawa ala. | I want to make music, but I am exhausted.  

## Time and Space

Talking about time and location ("space") are very similar: they both use primarily `lon` and they both can be used as the *context* in `la` phrases (see *[Advanced Grammar](#advanced-grammar)*).

*Time* is expressed as a noun phrase using `tenpo` and modifiers. The most common ones are `kama` (for future), `pini` (for past), `ni` (for present), `suno` (for day/daytime) and `pimeja` (for night); *"kama"*, *"pini"* and *"ni"* are often used in conjunction with the latter two.

> ona li lape lon tenpo pimeja. | She sleeps at night.  
> ona li kama apeja lon tenpo suno ni. | Today she is going to be miserable.  
> tenpo kama la ona li tawa tomo pali. | She will go to work.  
> tenpo pini la ona li pali ala. | She did not work before.  
> taso tenpo ni la ona li moku. | But she is \[only] eating for now.  

*Space* works similar to time, although with more variance: instead of having a single noun, we can use `ma` (for place in general; also "outside") and `tomo` (for house/building or "inside") among others. Spatial nouns after `lon` mean current location, and direction if they are preceded by `tawa`:

insa
: inside, within, among

poka
: on the side, next to, besides

sewi
: above

anpa
: below, under

sinpin
: in front, before

monsi
: behind, at the back, after

> soweli li lon insa tomo. | The cat is in the house.  
> soweli li lon poka pi jan lawa ona. | The dog is next to its owner.  
> soweli li lape lon soweli ante. | The cat is sleeping on the dog.  
> musi kiwen li lon supa lon sewi pi ilo pi sitelen tawa. | The \[cat] statue is on a shelf above the telly.  
> soweli li lape lon anpa supa. | The cat is sleeping under the bed.  
> soweli li tawa monsi tomo. | The cat goes behind the house \[presumably to sleep].  

## Numbers

Numbers are used less frequently than in most languages as there are only limited ways to express numbers over 10 and neither pronouns nor nouns are inherently *singular* or *plural*. There are 2 major systems of using numbers, that we will refer to as "short range" and "extended range", as well as a "mid range" which is commonly used (though mostly unrecognized):

| Number  | Short range     | Mid range    | Extended range | Note                                                  |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ala     | 0,&nbsp;none    | 0,&nbsp;none | 0              |                                                       |
| wan     | 1               | 1            | 1              |                                                       |
| tu      | 2               | 2            | 2              |                                                       |
| tuli    |                 |              | 3              | Archaic, it was removed from the dictionary early on. |
| po      |                 |              | 4              | Archaic, it was removed from the dictionary early on. |
| luka    |                 | 5            | 5              |                                                       |
| mute    | 2+,&nbsp;plural | 11+          | 20             |                                                       |
| ale/ali | all             | all          | 100,&nbsp;all  | Used for "all", "every" and "countless".              |

Numbers are *modifiers* that always go *after the last modifier,* but optionally *before the first "pi"* (see *[Advanced Grammar](#advanced-grammar)*). Unlike other modifiers, *pi* is never used in front of them. Numbers without specific words for them are formed by adding them up, starting with the largest -- this does not apply to short range since in that system only those single words are used. For example, *"luka tu wan"* is 8 (5&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1), while *"tu tu"* is 4 (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2).  
Ordinal numbers are expressed using `nanpa` followed by the number and work the same as regular numbers.

> soweli suwi tu wan | Three cats  
> soweli suwi tuli | Three cats  
> soweli suwi nanpa tu wan | The third cat  

## Advanced Grammar

`pi` is used to group modifiers. For example, *"jan pona suli mute"* would mean "big friends", but *"jan pona pi suli mute"* would mean "\[a] very big friend".  
When *spatial nouns* are used in *prepositional phrases,* a *"pi"* can be placed after the spatial noun if they are followed by more than one word.  
*Possessors* are noun phrases that go *after all the other modifiers*. If the possessor is more than one word or could be mistaken for a regular modifier, you *may* consider putting a *"pi"* in front of it.

> soweli suwi mi | my cat  
> soweli suwi tu mi | my two cats  
> soweli suwi mute pi jan Sotan | Zotn's cats  
> soweli suwi jan | humanoid cat OR a human's cat  
> soweli suwi pi jan | a human's cat  

The word `la` is used to separate *context* (or *condition*) and *main sentence*. The latter is a normal sentence, but the context can be virtually any phrase or a full sentence; most often it is a full sentence or a phrase denoting time or place.  
Prepositional phrases may be placed in front of *"la"* to indicate that its meaning applies to the whole sentence, although the preposition itself may be dropped.

> tenpo kama la mi pali mute. | In the future, I shall work more.  
> sina lon tomo la suno sewi li ken ala lukin e sina. | If/when you are at home, the the Sun&nbsp;god is unable to see you.  
> \[lon] ma tomo Uso la jan moli li tawa sin. | In Uso, dead people are walking again.  
> toki pona li pona tawa mi. | I like toki pona.  
> mi la toki pona li pona. | I like toki pona.
