## Dictionary

Words in toki pona often have vague definitions, their meaning depending on the context they appear in. They are also quite flexible as to where and how they appear within a sentence; for example *"kipisi"* at first only had the definition of "to cut", but this meaning can be extrapolated to mean "cut" as an adjective, or "cutting" as a noun. In this dictionary, multiple meanings are listed for most words, however this *does not* mean that words without a definition as a noun cannot be use as one in the right context. *Function* (or *grammatical*) words are the only exceptions to this rule.

There are multiple different dictionaries that can be found with word counts most ranging between 118--150. *pu*, the "official Toki Pona book" (2014) written by jan Sonja, had a 120/123 word dictionary -- where 6 words were merged in pairs. *ku*, the "Toki Pona Dictionary" (2021), also by jan Sonja, had a main word count ("ku suli") of 137, with even more words present as it contained every word that were in use at the time, among others ("ku lili"); this can add up as high as 190. Words that were coined by the community after *pu*'s release are colloquially called *"nimi sin"* (lit. new words).  
Due to the small number of words, definitions may be vague and toki pona relies more on context than most languages. It also prefers to "leave out" unimportant details, favoring simplicity.

This dictionary contains 146 words (136 common + 10 archaic ones), including the entirety of *pu*'s dictionary, in addition to select pre-pu words (that were either replaced or deprecated) and post-pu words -- these additions are all present in *ku*. Word usage can vary between groups and dialects, but generally it is best practice to mostly restrict ourselves to use words found in *pu*; non-pu words will have a `p`&shy;`u` version after their definitions to offer "pu friendly" alternatives and older, archaic words that are seldom used will be marked with a leading asterisk (`*`).
